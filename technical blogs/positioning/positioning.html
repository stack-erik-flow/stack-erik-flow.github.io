      <h1 id="title">How to Position your Elements</h1>

        <summary>
         The webpage space is broken up into block level tags which are sections 
         of space going from top to bottom and stacked on top of each other like blocks.
         This can be changed by using inline tags but the default is block tags. A 
         block tag will take up all the space from left to right and as much space 
         as you define from top to bottom. Position commands are how we move those 
         blocks into the places we want. This is an example of a parent div(block) 
         holding two child blocks. The green block is the one we will focus on.
        </summary>

        <example>

          <img src = "tools/positioning first image.PNG" 
          alt="boxes demonstrating positions">
          
          <img src = "tools/position 1st code.png" 
          alt="boxes demonstrating positions">

          
        </example>


       
      <h2>Static Positioning</h2>
        <p>The default position is static, and you cannot move sections 
        when they are static.</p>

      <h2>Relative Positioning</h2>
        <p>Relative allows you to move sections using the commands – top, right, bottom 
          & left. It moves based of its original position in the browser window
        Can use commands like “top: 50px” to move the section inwards from the top by 
        50 pixels and “top: -50px” outwards from the top its position.
        It does not remove elements from the document flow meaning that other elements 
        will still act like it is there even if you have repositioned it 100 million miles 
        away. Here we move from the top of the parent by 50px and the left of the parent by 500px.
        
        </p>

        <example>

          <img src = "tools/position relative image.PNG" 
          alt="boxes demonstrating positions">
          
          <img src = "tools/position relative code.png" 
          alt="boxes demonstrating positions">

          
        </example>

        <p>Notice that the blocks can move outside of the parent element.</p>

      <h2>Absolute Positioning</h2>
        <p>Absolute positioning, positions based on the borders of the parent element.
        You define which borders of the parent element are used based on which commands 
          you use. For example, if you code “right: 50px” & “bottom: 0 px” then the child 
          element will choose to move 50 pixels right from the left border of the parent
           element & 0 pixels upwards from the bottom of the parent element. It will end up 
           sitting in the bottom left somewhere (depending on the size of the parent element).
           It gets removed from the document flow when repositioned.</p>


        <example>

          <img src = "tools/position absolute image.PNG" 
          alt="boxes demonstrating positions">
          
          <img src = "tools/position absolute code.png" 
          alt="boxes demonstrating positions">

          
        </example>

        <p> Notice how the red box moved up to replace the position of the green box in this case.
          This is because the absolute positioning removes elements from the document flow.
        </p>

      <h2>Fixed positioning</h2>

      <p>Basically works the same as absolute positioning works, with the added 
        feature which makes it move with a resized browser window.</p>
