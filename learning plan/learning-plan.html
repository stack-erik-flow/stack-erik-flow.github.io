    <h1 id="title">My learning plan at Dev academy</h1>

      <h2>long term goal</h2>

        <p>Not entirely sure at this stage. 
            Just want to see how I go and see if I’m enjoying it. So far I am.
        </p>


      <h2>Description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h2>


        <p>  Dyslexia will help in that it enables me to think interconnectedly and so it will 
             assist in creative problem solving. However It will get in the way also since I 
             will need to rely more on other non-text based learning methods.
             Being tenacious will help in that I will not give up easily and will want to make 
             sure I truly understand what is going on.

             Honesty will help since I will want to learn as well as I can and have no desire to ‘fudge the results’
            My Meyers brigs results of being a mediator will help in that I will be willing to listen and learn and will value other options but will also mean that I will have a tendency to over emphasize my mistakes.

        
        </p>

      


    <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>

        <p>
            My ability to ask for help in a timely way. Confidence and communication. Effectiveness to work in a team
        </p>


    <h2>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</h2>

        <p>
            I will not do anything too stupid. Set a certain amount of time each day working on the project
        </p>
        

    <h2>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h2>

        <p>
            Manage my time well. Not panic. Ask for help when needed.
        </p>


    <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>

        <p>
            Probably start with slack.
        </p>


    <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>

        <p>
            Support and answering questions when needed
        </p>


    <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h2>

        <p>
            Don’t normally work Sundays. Like to schedule in other activities like sport.
        </p>
