      <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>

      <p>
        It only been a month and I have already done some coding before. The extra skills I learned were valuable but I cannot think of anything significant that I learned about myself.
      </p>

      <h2>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>

      <p>
        All of those things are good in any work environment. Its super important to be able to trust and get alongside your colleges. Self-awareness helps you understand where your failures are so you can work on them or express them and work around them if that’s not possible. It helps you know where your strengths and weaknesses are so you can work better with everyone. 
      </p>

      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>

      <p>
        I just cannot recall anything that really surprised me.
      </p>
      
      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>

      <p>
        Probably changing the html with javascript. It’s taking time to learn the interactions and how they work. It’s been enjoyable though
      </p>

      <h2>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>

      <p>
        For career development. You put a lot of emphasis that human skills are very important and that companies would prefer someone they get along with and can work well with over a very good programmer who has no human skills.
      </p>

      <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>

      <p>
        It’s a good idea overall but I would say it’s just overdone and becomes exhausting after a while. I would suggest cutting down the core questions by about one half so that you have time to reflect and communicate those reflections but you don’t feel like you have to explain yourself about everything. It would also allow more time to reflect on the questions remaining and that would mean better thought-out answers.
