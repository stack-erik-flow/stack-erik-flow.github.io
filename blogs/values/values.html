      <h2>Resistance to Productivity</h2>

      <p>
        When working on a group project at university trying to make non animal protein as a large final year project. I feel that the group was disjoint. We had a person who would work by himself and would not communicate with anyone. Someone who was cleaver and knew how to work well but was not good at communicating expectations and would often get frustrated at the other team members. Another person who was an excellent communicator and got on well with the smart person but failed to use his talents to allow the others in the team to work together effectively. I an attempt to smooth things out I tried to call plenty of meetings and they went relatively well with the people who turned up but then things would go back to how they were when the meeting adjourned. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What would I do now? Make more of an effort to explain clearly the issues as I see them. There were issues as a result of not knowing the direction the team was heading most of the time. Fortunately, in this situation I was solely responsible for the finances for this project and so at least that worked well and could be integrated rather seamlessly into the rest of the project. Perhaps if I could coax more of an understanding of why each member operated, the way they did that would have helped. 
      </p>

      <h2>Cultural Influence of Values</h2>

        <p>
            Plenty of good, some bad. I think the simple fact of having ethical laws which prevent things like violence and stealing have influenced me to larger degree than I give credit for. A general Kiwi openness and helpfulness has influenced me to be more generous and helpful myself. Growing up Christian has helped me value honesty loyalty and having a deep sense of purpose. On the bad side I think a combination of western and family culture has a tendency to undervalue or be afraid of deep friendships physical affection and open discussion which has influenced me.
        </p>



      <h2>Ethical Decision I Made</h2>

        <p>
            For some reason the only thing that comes to mind is when I was a kid, I decided to steal a 50-cent coin from my parents which was sitting on their desk. I knew it was wrong and thought about how it was wrong but decided to take it anyway. I remember later as us siblings were together, and we decided to count out all our money to compare. When I counted my money out all my siblings started praising me about how much money I had. Oh, the gilt. I never told anyone, but I ended up putting the 50 cents back on the desk.
        </p>


      <h2>Strengths and limitations for Learning</h2>

        <p>
            Dyslexia will help in that it enables me to think interconnectedly and so will assive in creative problem solving. However It will get in the way also since I will need to rely more on other non-text based learning methods.
            Being tenacious will help in that I will not give up easily and will want to make sure I truly understand what is going on.
            Honesty will help since I will want to learn as well as I can and have no desire to ‘fudge the results’
            My Meyers brigs results of being a mediator will help in that I will be willing to listen and learn and will value other options but will also mean that I will have a tendency to over emphasize my mistakes.

        </p>



      <h2>Strengths that Help my Learning Journey</h2>

        <p>
            Having some perfectionist tendencies may get in the way of learning a more holistic understanding of development since I may spend too much time which could be used on my talents of interconnected reasoning associated with having dyslexia 
            Tenacity may help in that I will not give up
            Tenacity may also be bad since I may keep trying beyond when I should be asking for help.
