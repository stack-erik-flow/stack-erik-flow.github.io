      <h1 id="title">My plan</h1>

      <h2>What are your long term goals</h2>

      <p>
        I’m hoping to learn how to have a good grasp on the fundamentals of software development and understand how all of the parts of software development work together. I want to be in a position where I can hit the ground running (or at least walking) when I get a developer position. I think eventually it would be really cool to be able to be a tech nomad.
      </p>

      <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>

      <p>
        Resilience will be my greatest strength. I think my greatest weakness will be allocation of my time.
      </p>

      <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>

      <p>
        Probably just knowing when to ask for help. I tend to try figure out everything by myself. I’m working on it.
      </p>

      <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>

      <p>
        Developing some leadership skills and Communication
      </p>

      <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>

      <p>
        Get a basic understanding of a large chuck of software that developers use and how to begin using them effectively for yourself. I would also like to learn a little more computer literacy to be able to understand more of the complex and integral ways the operating systems work.
      </p>

      <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>

      <p>
        I’m hoping that once we start at Re-leased I will have to rely less on slack and online conversations to get help and will be able to talk to other team members and support face to face.
      </p>
