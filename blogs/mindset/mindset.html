      <h1 id="title"> Neuroplasticity</h1>

      

      <h2>Describe how neuroplasticity is relevant to learning</h2>

      <p>
        Neurons that fire together wire together. You can change how your brain is wired. 
        Although you cannot increase your IQ you can still increase the strength of neural pathways and cause yourself 
        to automatically favour certain pathways and build connects to separate pathways. Your intelligence is set, and 
        it basically measures your learnability. You select environments which corelate with your genetic propensities.
          The theory is that in this situation, you will seek to be challenged, and because of that you are more likely 
          to learn more complex things. Therefore, your genetic traits on intelligence tend to show themselves 
          increasingly later in life. 
      </p>

      <h2>How I will engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for my own benefit</h2>

      <p>
        I think it mostly boils down to having good habits. These habits can be how you tend to react when things get tough or stressful or you when get stuck. They affect both how you react mentally and what steps you take to rectify the situation.
        They can affect things such as your work ethic and how you deal with distraction. It’s the old principle of "practice makes permanent", so practice good habits.

      <h2>What is Growth Mindset and why is it important?</h2>

      <p>
        It describes a mindset that welcomes a challenge. A mindset that understands the benefit of struggling to achieve something as opposed to only choosing to do things if they are easy. It’s important because you must understand that you cannot immediately win at everything you attempt. Failure is a part of life. It’s a necessary and even good part of life because it allows you to learn and grow.

      <h2>What surprised me?</h2>

      <p>
        I realized that more weight is put on learning JavaScript that on the other programing languages. I thought there would be more to HTML and CSS but I realize that they are actually really simple.
        
      </p>

      <h2>How will I integrate growth mindset into my learning journey?</h2>

      <p>
        By understanding that I will get stuck, feel frustrated, feel like I’m useless at times but that is no reason to give up as those feelings will pass. I know that when I’m challenged it’s a good thing and I cannot be expected to cruise though all the time.
